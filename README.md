### About This Series

### About Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot set**  is the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the function $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge to _infinity_ when iterated from $z=0$, i.e., for which the sequence$f_c(0), \space f_c(f_c(0)), \space f_c(f_c(f_c(0)))$ etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

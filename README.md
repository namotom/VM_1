### About This Series

Many people find Maths very intimidating. I personally find Mathematics a very intereseting subject. And I always asked myself this question:-
<p align ="center">"Wouldn't it be great if were able to visualize the true beauty of maths?"</p>

And to answer to this is: **_Visualizing Maths_** , a series of projects where I will be taking on various mathematical concepts and try to show you the beautiful side of maths.

### About Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot set**  is the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the function $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge to _infinity_ when iterated from $z=0$, i.e., for which the sequence$f_c(0), \space f_c(f_c(0)), \space f_c(f_c(f_c(0)))$ etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
